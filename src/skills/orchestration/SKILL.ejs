# Orchestration Skills

This skill package provides workflow orchestration utilities for coordinating complex multi-agent development tasks.

## Available Skills

- **flight-plan** (`/reaper:flight-plan`) - Chart work into flight-ready issues with dependencies mapped
- **takeoff** (`/reaper:takeoff`) - Dispatch agents through quality gates until work lands on your desk
- **status-worktrees** (`/reaper:status-worktrees`) - Radar sweep your parallel worktrees for progress and drift
- **claude-sync** (`/reaper:claude-sync`) - Surface changes since CLAUDE.md last touched down

## Purpose

These skills orchestrate the Reaper workflow:

1. **Planning** - `flight-plan` breaks down work into trackable issues with dependencies
2. **Execution** - `takeoff` dispatches specialized agents with quality gate enforcement
3. **Monitoring** - `status-worktrees` tracks parallel development progress across worktrees
4. **Maintenance** - `claude-sync` keeps documentation current with code changes
