## Visual Vocabulary

> **Opt-out**: If the project's CLAUDE.md contains the line `Reaper: disable ASCII art`, emit plain text status labels only. No gauge bars, no box-drawing, no card templates. Use the `functional` context behavior regardless of the `context` parameter.

> **Rendering constraint**: One line, one direction, no column alignment. Every visual element must be renderable in a single horizontal pass. No multi-line box-drawing that requires vertical alignment across columns. Exception: The `start` context uses box-drawing for its welcome screen cards, which are rendered once as orientation content rather than repeated status displays.

### Gauge States

Five semantic states expressed as fixed-width 10-block bars. Use these consistently across all commands to communicate work status.

<% if (context === 'functional') { -%>
Status labels (plain text, no visual ornament):

- **LANDED** -- complete, healthy
- **ON APPROACH** -- coding done, quality gates running
- **IN FLIGHT** -- work in progress
- **TAXIING** -- waiting, not started
- **FAULT** -- failed, needs attention
<% } else { -%>
```
  ██████████  LANDED       complete, healthy
  ████████░░  ON APPROACH  coding done, quality gates running
  ██████░░░░  IN FLIGHT    work in progress
  ░░░░░░░░░░  TAXIING     waiting, not started
  ░░░░!!░░░░  FAULT        failed, needs attention
```

Gauge usage rules:
- Always use exactly 10 blocks per bar (full-width = 10 filled, empty = 10 unfilled).
- The exclamation marks in the FAULT bar replace two blocks at the center to signal breakage.
- Pair each bar with its label and a short gloss on the same line.
<% } -%>

### Quality Gate Statuses

<% if (context === 'functional') { -%>
Gate status labels (plain text, no visual ornament):

- **PASS** -- gate passed all checks
- **FAIL** -- gate found blocking issues
- **RUNNING** -- gate currently executing
- **PENDING** -- gate not yet started
- **SKIP** -- gate not applicable to this work type

Gate statuses are inspection verdicts, not work lifecycle states. Use gauge states for work unit progress, gate statuses for quality inspection results.
<% } else { -%>
Five inspection verdicts for quality gate results. Gate statuses are inspection verdicts, not work lifecycle states. Use gauge states for work unit progress, gate statuses for quality inspection results.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **PASS** | gate passed all checks |
| **FAIL** | gate found blocking issues |
| **RUNNING** | gate currently executing |
| **PENDING** | gate not yet started |
| **SKIP** | gate not applicable to this work type |
<% } -%>
<% if (context === 'takeoff') { -%>

### Preflight Card

Render before work begins. Shows the mission parameters the command will execute against.

```
  PREFLIGHT
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Task:       [TASK-ID]
  Branch:     [branch-name]
  Worktree:   [worktree-path]
  Units:      [N work units planned]
  Strategy:   [execution strategy]
  ░░░░░░░░░░  TAXIING
```

### Gate Panel

Render after each quality gate completes. Shows gate results inline. Gate results use gate statuses (PASS, FAIL, RUNNING, PENDING, SKIP), not gauge bars.

```
  GATE RESULTS
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  test-runner       PASS
  code-reviewer     RUNNING
  security-auditor  PENDING
```

Gate panel rules:
- One row per gate agent.
- Gate name left-aligned, gate status right of name. No gauge bars in the Gate Panel.
- Update rows as gates complete -- replace PENDING with PASS or FAIL.
<% } else if (context === 'ship') { -%>

### Departure Card

Render when the ship command begins. Shows what is being shipped.

```
  DEPARTURE
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Worktree:   [worktree-path]
  Branch:     [branch-name]
  Commits:    [N commits to ship]
  Target:     [target branch or PR]
  ██████░░░░  IN FLIGHT
```

### Landing Card

Render when the ship command completes. Shows the result of the PR or merge.

```
  LANDING
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  PR:         [PR-URL or merge result]
  Status:     [merged / opened / failed]
  ██████████  LANDED
```
<% } else if (context === 'status-worktrees') { -%>

### Fleet Dashboard

Render as a multi-row status overview. One row per worktree.

```
  FLEET STATUS
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  trees/TASK-004-search     ░░░░!!░░░░  FAULT
  trees/TASK-002-billing    ██████░░░░  IN FLIGHT
  trees/TASK-005-payments   ████████░░  ON APPROACH
  trees/TASK-003-notifs     ░░░░░░░░░░  TAXIING
  trees/TASK-001-auth       ██████████  LANDED
```

Fleet dashboard rules:
- One row per worktree. Path left-aligned, gauge bar and state right.
- Sort: FAULT first, then IN FLIGHT, then ON APPROACH, then TAXIING, then LANDED.
- If no worktrees exist, show a single line: `No active worktrees.`
<% } else if (context === 'squadron') { -%>

Squadron has its own visual vocabulary (mission cards, scorecards, tension diagrams, consensus markers) defined in the squadron command. This partial provides only the gauge states above for reuse. Do not duplicate squadron-specific visual elements here.
<% } else if (context === 'start') { -%>

### Runway Card

Render when the start command is invoked with no input (bare invocation). Shows the three workflow entrypoints and how they connect.

```
  REAPER
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Three workflows. Each builds on the last.

  ┌─ SQUADRON ─────────────────────────┐

```

Runway card rules:
- Show exactly three entrypoint boxes in the order: SQUADRON, FLIGHT-PLAN, TAKEOFF.
- Connect each pair with `↓ feeds into` between closing and opening boxes.
- Each box contains: tagline (bold first line), description (2-3 lines), and command syntax.
- Use the REAPER branded header with heavy rule (━━━) at the top.

### Input Analysis Card

Render when the start command is invoked with user input. Shows the parsed input, key elements extracted, and routing factors that determine which workflow to recommend.

Input analysis card rules:
- Quote the user's input verbatim inside the box, wrapped in double quotes.
- KEY ELEMENTS section: Extract 2-4 key concerns from the input, each with a ★ bullet and a sub-detail line.
- ROUTING FACTORS section: List factors as key-value pairs that explain why a specific workflow is recommended (e.g., Complexity, Scope, Dependencies, Design risk).
- Separate sections with `* * *` centered dividers.
- Use the REAPER branded header with heavy rule (━━━) at the top.
