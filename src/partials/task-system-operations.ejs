## Task System Operations

### Detection

Detect the active task system before performing any operations:
1. Check for `.beads/` directory in project root (Beads)
2. Check for `acli` CLI availability (Jira)
3. If neither is detected, fall back to markdown-only mode (no external task system)

### Abstract Operations

Use these operations to interact with whatever task system is detected. The LLM maps each operation to the appropriate system commands or markdown equivalents.

| Operation | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| FETCH_ISSUE | Retrieve a single issue by ID (title, description, status, acceptance criteria) |
| LIST_CHILDREN | List direct child issues of a parent (one level deep) |
| CREATE_ISSUE | Create a new issue with title, description, and optional parent |
| UPDATE_ISSUE | Modify an existing issue (status, description, assignee) |
| ADD_DEPENDENCY | Create a dependency relationship between two issues |
| QUERY_DEPENDENCY_TREE | Recursively retrieve the full dependency graph from a root issue |
| CLOSE_ISSUE | Mark an issue as completed/closed |

### Dependency Type Semantics

When creating or querying dependencies, preserve the relationship type:

- **parent-child**: Hierarchical decomposition (epic contains stories, story contains tasks)
- **blocks**: Sequential constraint (task A must complete before task B can start)
- **related**: Informational link (tasks share context but no execution dependency)
