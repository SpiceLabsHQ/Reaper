## Quality Gate Protocol
<% if (typeof role !== 'undefined' && role === 'orchestrator') { -%>

### Gate Sequence

All work passes through two sequential gates before reaching the user:

**Gate 1 (blocking):** Deploy reaper:test-runner. Must pass before Gate 2 proceeds.

**Gate 2 (parallel):** Deploy reaper:code-reviewer and reaper:security-auditor simultaneously in a single message. Both must pass.

After all gates pass, present completed work to the user and seek feedback.

### JSON Validation Keys

Parse these fields from each gate agent's JSON response to determine pass/fail:

| Key | Source | Pass Condition |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| `test_exit_code` | reaper:test-runner | `=== 0` |
| `coverage_percentage` | reaper:test-runner | `>= 80` |
| `lint_exit_code` | reaper:test-runner | `=== 0` |
| `all_checks_passed` | all gate agents | `=== true` |
| `blocking_issues` | all gate agents | empty array |

### Iteration Rules

- On any gate failure, redeploy the coding agent with `blocking_issues` from the failed gate
- After the coding agent addresses issues, re-run the failed gate (not all gates)
- Maximum 3 iterations per gate before escalating to the user
- Work autonomously through iterations without asking the user for guidance

### Commit on Pass

After each gate passes, deploy reaper:branch-manager to commit the current state on the feature branch. Frequent commits on feature branches create restore points and document progress.

### Parallel Deployment Pattern

After Gate 1 passes, deploy Gate 2 agents in a single message with two Task calls:
```
Task --subagent_type reaper:code-reviewer --prompt "..."
Task --subagent_type reaper:security-auditor --prompt "..."
```

If either fails, combine `blocking_issues` from both before redeploying the coding agent.

### Information Handoff

- **Coding agent to reaper:test-runner**: Pass `narrative_report.summary` for test scope context, plus TEST_COMMAND and LINT_COMMAND from project config
- **reaper:test-runner to reaper:code-reviewer**: Pass full test results JSON (test_exit_code, coverage_percentage, lint_exit_code, test_metrics)
- **reaper:test-runner to reaper:security-auditor**: Pass plan context only (security-auditor does not need test results)
<% } else { -%>

Quality gates validate all work before it reaches the user:

1. **reaper:test-runner** (blocking) -- tests, coverage, linting
2. **reaper:code-reviewer + reaper:security-auditor** (parallel, blocking) -- code quality and security

Auto-iteration on failure, maximum 3 attempts per gate. The takeoff skill owns gate execution and iteration.
