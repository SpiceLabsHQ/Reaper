## Agent Deployment Template

Every agent deployment uses this structure:

```
Task --subagent_type [AGENT_TYPE] \
  --description "[BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]" \
  --prompt "TASK: $TASK_ID
WORKTREE: $WORKTREE_PATH
DESCRIPTION: [detailed requirements from plan or task system]
SCOPE: [exact file/module boundaries]
RESTRICTION: [what NOT to touch]
QUALITY: [coverage target, lint requirements, methodology]"
```

**Example:**
```
Task --subagent_type reaper:feature-developer \
  --description "Implement OAuth2 feature" \
  --prompt "TASK: repo-a3f
WORKTREE: ./trees/repo-a3f-oauth
DESCRIPTION: Implement OAuth2 authentication flow with Google and GitHub providers
SCOPE: Authentication module only (src/auth/oauth/, tests/auth/oauth/)
RESTRICTION: Do NOT modify user management or database modules
QUALITY: 80% test coverage, zero linting errors, SOLID principles"
```

**Requirements for every deployment:**
- TASK and WORKTREE must always be provided
- DESCRIPTION must be detailed and substantial (from plan, task system, or user input)
- SCOPE must specify exact file or module boundaries
- RESTRICTION must specify what NOT to modify (keeps agents focused on scope)
- Keep each work package to a maximum of 5 files, 500 LOC, and 2 hours of estimated work
