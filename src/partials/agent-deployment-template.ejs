## Agent Deployment Template

Every agent deployment uses this structure:

```
Task --subagent_type [AGENT_TYPE] \
  --description "[BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]" \
  --prompt "TASK: $TASK_ID
WORKTREE: $WORKTREE_PATH
BRIEF: [one-sentence summary of the work]
SCOPE: [glob patterns for file/module boundaries]
RESTRICTION: [what NOT to touch]"
```

**Example:**
```
Task --subagent_type reaper:feature-developer \
  --description "Implement OAuth2 feature" \
  --prompt "TASK: repo-a3f
WORKTREE: ./trees/repo-a3f-oauth
BRIEF: Implement OAuth2 authentication flow with Google and GitHub providers
SCOPE: src/auth/** tests/auth/**
RESTRICTION: Do NOT modify user management or database modules"
```

**Requirements for every deployment:**
- TASK and WORKTREE must always be provided
- BRIEF must be a single sentence summarizing the work (detailed context lives in the plan or task system)
- SCOPE must use glob patterns for file or module boundaries
- RESTRICTION must specify what NOT to modify (keeps agents focused on scope)
- Prefer keeping each work package to roughly 5 files, 500 LOC, and 2 hours of estimated work (adjust based on complexity)

**After the agent returns:** Run quality gates on the completed work. Once all gates pass, check TodoWrite for the next pending work unit and continue the Per-Unit Cycle.
