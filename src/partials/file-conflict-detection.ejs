### File Conflict Detection (Strategy 2: Single Branch Parallel Work)

**If working on a single branch with other agents:**

```bash
# Before making changes, check git status
cd "[WORKTREE_OR_ROOT]"
git status

# If you see UNEXPECTED modified files (not yours):
# - Another agent is editing files concurrently
# - EXIT IMMEDIATELY with conflict report
# - Orchestrator will resolve the conflict

# Example detection:
if git status --short | grep -v "^M.*YOUR_FILES"; then
  echo "ERROR: File conflict detected - external edits to non-assigned files"
  echo "EXITING: Orchestrator must resolve concurrent edit conflict"
  exit 1
fi
```

**When to exit with conflict:**
- Files you're assigned to work on show unexpected changes
- Git status shows modifications you didn't make
- Another agent is clearly working on your files

**What orchestrator does:**
- Determines which agent made the conflicting edits
- Reassigns work OR sequences work units
- Redeploys you with updated instructions
