### File Conflict Detection (Strategy 2: Shared Worktree Parallel Work)

**If working in a shared worktree with other agents:**

Strategy 2 (medium_single_branch) uses a single shared worktree where multiple agents work concurrently with exclusive file assignments. Each agent must detect and exit if its assigned files are unexpectedly modified by another agent.

```bash
# Before making changes, check git status in the shared worktree
git -C "[WORKTREE_PATH]" status

# If you see UNEXPECTED modified files (not yours):
# - Another agent is editing files concurrently
# - EXIT IMMEDIATELY with conflict report
# - Orchestrator will resolve the conflict

# Example detection:
if git -C "[WORKTREE_PATH]" status --short | grep -v "^M.*YOUR_FILES"; then
  echo "ERROR: File conflict detected - external edits to non-assigned files"
  echo "EXITING: Orchestrator must resolve concurrent edit conflict"
  exit 1
fi
```

**When to exit with conflict:**
- Files you're assigned to work on show unexpected changes
- Git status shows modifications you didn't make
- Another agent is clearly working on your files

**What orchestrator does:**
- Determines which agent made the conflicting edits
- Reassigns work OR sequences work units
- Redeploys you with updated instructions
