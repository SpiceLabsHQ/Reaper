## Mission Header

> **Opt-out**: If the target project's CLAUDE.md contains the line `Reaper: disable ASCII art`, output nothing — skip the header entirely.

> **Render-once directive**: Render this header immediately as the first user-visible output of the command, before any tool calls or information gathering. Do not re-render it at any later point in the same session.
