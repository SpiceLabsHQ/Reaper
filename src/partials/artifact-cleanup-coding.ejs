## Artifact Cleanup

Clean up all tool-generated artifacts before completion.

### Common TDD Bug-Fix Artifacts to Clean

**Coverage Artifacts (From TDD Testing):**
- `coverage/` - Coverage reports from your targeted tests
- `.nyc_output/` - NYC coverage cache
- `htmlcov/` - Python HTML coverage reports
- `.coverage` - Python coverage data file
- `lcov.info` - LCOV coverage data

**Test Cache and Temporary Files:**
- `.pytest_cache/` - Pytest cache directory
- `__pycache__/` - Python bytecode cache
- `.tox/` - Tox test environment
- `test-results.json` - Test results from TDD cycles
- `junit.xml` - JUnit test output

**Linter Artifacts:**
- `.eslintcache` - ESLint cache
- `.ruff_cache/` - Ruff linter cache
- `.php-cs-fixer.cache` - PHP CS Fixer cache
- `.rubocop-cache/` - RuboCop cache

**Build Artifacts (From Testing):**
- `.tsbuildinfo` - TypeScript incremental build info
- `target/debug/` - Rust debug builds from tests

### Cleanup Workflow

**1. Use Tools → 2. Extract Data → 3. Clean Up**

```bash
# Step 1: Execute TDD bug reproduction and fix testing (tools create artifacts)
(cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && npm test -- path/to/bug-fix.test.js --coverage)

# Step 2: Note development test status (don't include in JSON - not authoritative)
# Your tests passing = TDD feedback ✅
# NOT for quality gate decisions ❌

# Step 3: Clean up ALL artifacts before returning

# Directories with nested content - use find pattern
find "$WORKTREE_PATH/coverage" -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
find "$WORKTREE_PATH/coverage" -depth -type d -delete 2>/dev/null || true

find "$WORKTREE_PATH/.nyc_output" -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
find "$WORKTREE_PATH/.nyc_output" -depth -type d -delete 2>/dev/null || true

find "$WORKTREE_PATH/htmlcov" -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
find "$WORKTREE_PATH/htmlcov" -depth -type d -delete 2>/dev/null || true

find "$WORKTREE_PATH/__pycache__" -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
find "$WORKTREE_PATH/__pycache__" -depth -type d -delete 2>/dev/null || true

find "$WORKTREE_PATH/.pytest_cache" -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
find "$WORKTREE_PATH/.pytest_cache" -depth -type d -delete 2>/dev/null || true

find "$WORKTREE_PATH/.ruff_cache" -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
find "$WORKTREE_PATH/.ruff_cache" -depth -type d -delete 2>/dev/null || true

find "$WORKTREE_PATH/.tox" -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
find "$WORKTREE_PATH/.tox" -depth -type d -delete 2>/dev/null || true

# Individual files - keep simple rm pattern
rm -f "$WORKTREE_PATH/test-results.json"
rm -f "$WORKTREE_PATH/junit.xml"
rm -f "$WORKTREE_PATH/.eslintcache"
rm -f "$WORKTREE_PATH/.coverage"
rm -f "$WORKTREE_PATH/lcov.info"
rm -f "$WORKTREE_PATH/.tsbuildinfo"
```

### Why This Matters

**Problem Without Cleanup:**
- Coverage artifacts accumulate from TDD cycles (RED-GREEN-BLUE creates coverage/)
- Test cache files waste disk space (.pytest_cache/, .nyc_output/)
- Confuses test-runner with stale coverage data from bug reproduction tests
- May interfere with authoritative test-runner validation
- Creates noise in git status

**Your Responsibility:**
- Clean up after TDD bug-fix cycles
- Don't leave coverage artifacts from your targeted testing
- Let test-runner generate clean, authoritative coverage data
- Include cleanup evidence in JSON response field `artifacts_cleaned`
- Report cleanup failures but don't block on them
