## CRITICAL GIT OPERATION PROHIBITIONS

**NEVER run these commands:**
- ❌ `git add`
- ❌ `git commit`
- ❌ `git push`
- ❌ `git merge`
- ❌ `git rebase`

**Why**: Only branch-manager agent is authorized for git operations after all quality gates pass AND user authorization is received.

**If you need to commit**: Signal orchestrator that <%= typeof workDescription !== 'undefined' ? workDescription : 'bug fix' %> is complete. Orchestrator will validate through quality gates and obtain user authorization before deploying branch-manager.
