## Background Task Cleanup

At every work unit boundary (before starting the next unit or before signaling completion), clean up background tasks:

1. List all active background tasks to identify which are still running.
2. Identify tasks no longer needed for the next work unit.
3. Call TaskStop for each unneeded task. If a TaskStop call fails, log the error and continue -- do not block the workflow.
4. Confirm all stops completed before proceeding to the next work unit.

**Stop** (no longer needed): completed agents, finished test runs, builds that produced their output, explore commands that returned results.

**Keep** (still needed): dev servers, databases, file watchers, and any long-lived process the next work unit depends on.
