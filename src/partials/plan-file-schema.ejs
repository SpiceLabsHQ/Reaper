## Plan File

### Plan File Sections

A plan file at `.claude/plans/reaper-*.md` may contain: Input, Research, Strategy, Work Units, Dependencies.

### Extraction Priority

When reading a plan file, extract sections in this order of importance:
1. **Work Units** -- the decomposed tasks to execute
2. **Dependencies** -- execution order and blocking relationships
3. **Research** -- codebase context for agent prompts
4. **Strategy** -- selected strategy and complexity rationale

### Adapting to Plan Completeness

- **No plan file found**: Run the full workflow (deploy reaper:workflow-planner for analysis)
- **Plan with Research only**: Deploy reaper:workflow-planner with research as input context
- **Plan with Research + Work Units**: Skip planner, extract work units directly
- **Plan with Research + Work Units + Strategy**: Skip planner entirely, use provided strategy
