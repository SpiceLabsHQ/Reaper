## Plan File
<% if (typeof mode !== 'undefined' && mode === 'writer') { -%>

### Path Convention

Write the plan to: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/plans/reaper-[semantic-name].md`

Derive the semantic name from the planning request (2-4 words, lowercase, hyphenated).

### Schema

Create the plan file with this structure on first write:

```markdown
# Plan: [Title from input]

## Input
[Original user request - IMMUTABLE after initial write]

## Research
[Codebase research findings - progressively added]

## Strategy
[Selected strategy name, complexity score with breakdown, rationale for strategy choice]

## Work Units
| # | Title | Type | Status | Blocked By |
[Table of decomposed work units with details below]

## Dependencies
[Mermaid flowchart showing execution order and blocking relationships]
```

<% } else { -%>

### Plan File Sections

A plan file at `.claude/plans/reaper-*.md` may contain: Input, Research, Strategy, Work Units, Dependencies.

### Extraction Priority

When reading a plan file, extract sections in this order of importance:
1. **Work Units** -- the decomposed tasks to execute
2. **Dependencies** -- execution order and blocking relationships
3. **Research** -- codebase context for agent prompts
4. **Strategy** -- selected strategy and complexity rationale

### Adapting to Plan Completeness

- **No plan file found**: Run the full workflow (deploy reaper:workflow-planner for analysis)
- **Plan with Research only**: Deploy reaper:workflow-planner with research as input context
- **Plan with Research + Work Units**: Skip planner, extract work units directly
- **Plan with Research + Work Units + Strategy**: Skip planner entirely, use provided strategy
