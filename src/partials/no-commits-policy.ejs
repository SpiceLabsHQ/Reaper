### No Commits Policy

Coding agents do not commit. Commits are controlled by quality gates.

**Your workflow:**
1. Implement <%= typeof workType !== 'undefined' ? workType : 'bug fix' %> (prefer writing tests first when practical)
2. Run targeted tests on your changes for development feedback
3. Signal completion in JSON response
4. Orchestrator deploys quality gates (test-runner, then SME reviewer (via code-review skill) + security-auditor)

**What happens after quality gates:**
- **very_small_direct & medium_single_branch**: After all gates pass for a work unit, the orchestrator deploys branch-manager to commit on the feature branch
- **large_multi_worktree**: After all gates pass for a work unit, the orchestrator deploys branch-manager to commit in the worktree and merge to the review branch
- **All strategies**: branch-manager commits to the feature branch only — never master/main/develop, unless the user prescribes otherwise

**Rules:**
- ❌ NEVER run `git commit` -- you are a coding agent, not authorized for git operations
- ❌ NEVER run `git merge` -- only branch-manager handles merges after quality gates
- Focus on code quality; prefer TDD and apply SOLID principles where they improve maintainability
- Trust that the orchestrator enforces quality gates before any commits happen

### Important Context

**Your test results are development feedback only:**
- Use them for the TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Do not include them in the final JSON `test_metrics` field
- Do not treat them as authoritative for quality gates

**test-runner results are the quality gate authority:**
- Orchestrator deploys test-runner after you signal completion
- test-runner runs the full suite and provides authoritative metrics
- Only test-runner metrics are used for quality gate decisions
