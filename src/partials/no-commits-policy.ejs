### No Commits Policy (ALL Strategies)

**Coding agents NEVER commit - commits are controlled by quality gates:**

**Your workflow (all strategies):**
1. Implement <%= typeof workType !== 'undefined' ? workType : 'bug fix' %> with TDD (Red-Green-Refactor)
2. Run targeted tests on YOUR changes for development feedback
3. Signal completion in JSON response
4. Orchestrator deploys quality gates (test-runner → code-reviewer + security-auditor)

**What happens after quality gates:**
- **Strategy 1 & 2**: Quality gates pass → user commits and merges manually when ready
- **Strategy 3**: Quality gates pass → orchestrator directs branch-manager to commit in worktree and merge to review branch
- **All strategies**: User always manually merges final work to develop/main

**Critical rules:**
- ❌ NEVER run `git commit` - you are a coding agent, not authorized for git operations
- ❌ NEVER run `git merge` - only branch-manager handles merges after quality gates
- ✅ Focus on: Code quality, TDD methodology, SOLID principles
- ✅ Trust: Orchestrator enforces quality gates before any commits happen

### Important Context

**Your test results = development feedback only:**
- Use for TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle ✅
- Do NOT include in final JSON test_metrics ❌
- Do NOT treat as authoritative for quality gates ❌

**test-runner results = quality gate authority:**
- Orchestrator deploys test-runner after you signal completion
- test-runner runs full suite, provides authoritative metrics
- Only test-runner metrics used for quality gate decisions
