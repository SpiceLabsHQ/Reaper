{"id":"reaper-yuii","title":"Layered task system detection via commit history analysis","description":"## Summary\n\nReplace the current naive task system detection in `task-system-operations.ejs` with a layered detection strategy that prioritizes permission-free signals (commit history, env vars, filesystem) over CLI invocations that may trigger user permission prompts.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe current detection logic (lines 5-8 of `src/partials/task-system-operations.ejs`) has three issues:\n\n1. **Beads detection is fragile** — only checks for `.beads/` in project root, but `BEADS_DIR` env var can relocate the database to an arbitrary path\n2. **CLI checks may trigger permission prompts** — checking for `acli` availability runs a shell command that Claude Code may ask the user to approve, creating friction\n3. **GitHub Issues not supported** — projects using GH Issues fall straight through to markdown-only mode despite having a perfectly good task system\n\n## Solution: Layered Detection\n\nImplement a 3-layer detection chain where each layer is only invoked if prior layers are inconclusive.\n\n### Layer 1: Commit History Pattern Scan (zero permission prompts)\n\nRun `git log --format=\"%B\" -30` and scan commit bodies for issue reference patterns:\n\n| System | Pattern | Examples |\n|--------|---------|----------|\n| Beads | `(Ref:\\|Closes\\|Resolves)\\s+\\w+-[a-f0-9]{2,}` | `Ref: reaper-a3f`, `Closes myapp-bc12` |\n| Jira | `(Ref:\\|Fixes\\|Closes\\|Resolves)\\s+[A-Z]{2,}-\\d+` | `Ref: PROJ-123`, `Fixes ENG-456` |\n| GitHub Issues | `(Fixes\\|Closes\\|Resolves)\\s+#\\d+` | `Fixes #456`, `Closes #42` |\n\n**Confidence threshold**: 3+ matches of the same system type = strong signal. The pattern must be universal — do NOT try to detect or store the specific Beads prefix (e.g. `reaper-`). Only identify the system shape.\n\n**Disambiguation**: Jira (`PROJ-123`) and Linear (`ENG-123`) share the same pattern shape. GitHub Issues (`#123`) and GitLab Issues (`#123`) also overlap. Disambiguation happens in Layer 2 using the remote URL or filesystem markers.\n\n### Layer 2: Filesystem \u0026 Environment (zero permission prompts)\n\n- **Beads**: Check `$BEADS_DIR` env var first (authoritative if set — the database is wherever it points). If unset, check `.beads/` in project root (the default location). Either signal confirms Beads.\n- **GitHub vs GitLab**: Parse `git remote get-url origin` — `github.com` in URL confirms GitHub Issues; `gitlab.com` confirms GitLab Issues.\n- **Jira vs Linear**: Check for `.linear/` directory or similar config markers.\n\nThis layer confirms or disambiguates Layer 1 results.\n\n### Layer 3: CLI Confirmation (may trigger prompts — last resort only)\n\nOnly invoke when Layers 1-2 are ambiguous or produce no signal:\n\n- **Beads**: `bd status` — exit code 0 = active Beads project\n- **GitHub**: `gh issue list --limit 1` — confirms GH Issues are enabled on the repo\n- **Jira**: `acli` availability check\n\n### Fallback Chain\n\n```\nCommit patterns found (3+ matches)?\n  ├─ Yes → Confirm with Layer 2 → DONE (high confidence)\n  ├─ Mixed/ambiguous → Layer 2 disambiguation → Layer 3 if still unclear\n  └─ No patterns → Layer 2 → Layer 3 → markdown_only\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- **`src/partials/task-system-operations.ejs`** — Replace the current 3-line detection heuristic (lines 3-8) with the full layered detection algorithm\n- **`src/commands/flight-plan.ejs`** — Verify it correctly consumes the new detection (may need no changes if the partial's interface stays the same)\n- **`src/commands/takeoff.ejs`** — Same verification\n- **`src/commands/ship.ejs`** — Consider whether ship's separate task ID regex (lines 91-116) should reference the centralized patterns\n- **`src/agents/workflow-planner.ejs`** — Same verification\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Layer 1 (commit history scan) is the primary detection method and runs with zero permission prompts\n- [ ] Beads detection checks `$BEADS_DIR` env var before falling back to `.beads/` directory\n- [ ] GitHub Issues detected as a task system (new capability)\n- [ ] CLI-based checks (`bd status`, `gh`, `acli`) only invoked when passive detection is inconclusive\n- [ ] `TASK_SYSTEM` output values remain compatible: at minimum Beads, Jira, GitHub, markdown_only\n- [ ] All existing consumers (flight-plan, takeoff, workflow-planner) work without breaking changes\n- [ ] Detection instructions are clear enough that the LLM can execute them deterministically","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-02-11T20:37:20.248866-08:00","created_by":"ryan","updated_at":"2026-02-11T20:57:38.652781-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-11T20:57:38.652781-08:00","close_reason":"Layered task system detection implemented and merged to develop (f89465b)"}
